## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To contribute, you'll need:
- **Python 3.7+**: Ensure you have a compatible Python version installed.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and managing version control.
- **pip** or **uv**: For installing dependencies.
- A **Djelia API key**: Sign up at [djelia.cloud](https://djelia.cloud) to get one.
- A valid audio file (e.g., `audio.wav`) for testing transcription and TTS features.

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/djelia/djelia-python-sdk.git
   cd djelia-python-sdk
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies for development:
   ```bash
   pip install -e . 
   pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```
   Alternatively, use `uv` for faster dependency resolution:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e . 
   uv pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Pre-Commit Hooks**:
   Install pre-commit to enforce code style:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API key and test audio file path:
   ```bash
   echo "DJELIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" >> .env
   echo "TEST_AUDIO_FILE=/path/to/your/audio.wav" >> .env
   ```

5. **Run the Cookbook**:
   Verify your setup by running the test suite:
   ```bash
   python -m cookbook.main
   ```
   This executes the Djelia SDK Cookbook, testing translation, transcription, and TTS features.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Found a bug? Help us squash it! 
- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/djelia/djelia-python-sdk/issues) to ensure the bug hasn't been reported.
- Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) to submit a new issue.
- Include:
  - A clear description of the bug.
  - Steps to reproduce it.
  - Expected and actual behavior.
  - Logs or screenshots, if applicable.
- Tag `@sudoping01` in your issue for faster review.

### Suggesting Features

Have an idea to make the SDK even better? 
- Submit a feature request using the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).
- Describe the problem your feature solves and your proposed solution.
- Mention any alternatives you've considered.
- Tag `@sudoping01` to ensure visibility.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Ready to contribute code or documentation? Here's how:
1. **Fork the Repository**:
   Fork the [Djelia Python SDK repo](https://github.com/djelia/djelia-python-sdk) and clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/djelia-python-sdk.git
   ```

2. **Create a Branch**:
   Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes**:
   - Follow the [code style guidelines](#code-style-and-quality).
   - Update or add tests in the `cookbook` module if your changes affect functionality.
   - Update `README.md` or other documentation if needed.

4. **Run Code Style Checks**:
   Ensure your code passes linting and formatting:
   ```bash
   ./fix-code.sh
   ```
   This runs `ruff`, `isort`, and optionally `black` (if enabled in `dev-requirements.txt`).

5. **Test Your Changes**:
   Run the cookbook to verify your changes:
   ```bash
   python -m cookbook.main
   ```
   Ensure all tests pass and no new errors are introduced.

6. **Commit Your Changes**:
   Use clear, concise commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
   ```

7. **Push and Create a Pull Request**:
   Push your branch and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   - Use the pull request template and link to related issues.
   - Describe your changes, their purpose, and any testing done.
   - Tag `@sudoping01` for review.

8. **Address Feedback**:
   Respond to reviewer comments and make necessary updates. The GitHub Actions workflow (`code-check.yml`) will run `ruff` and `isort` to ensure code quality.

## Code Style and Quality

To maintain consistency, we use:
- **Ruff**: For linting and formatting. Run `ruff check .` to verify.
- **isort**: For sorting imports. Use `isort . --check-only` to check.
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Automatically run `ruff` and `isort` before commits.
- **Black** (optional): If enabled in `dev-requirements.txt`, run `black .` for formatting.

Before submitting a pull request:
- Run `./fix-code.sh` to apply fixes automatically.
- Ensure no linting errors remain with `ruff check .` and `isort . --check-only`.

## Testing

All contributions should include tests to ensure reliability:
- Use the `cookbook` module (`cookbook/cookbook.py`) as a reference for writing tests.
- Add new tests for new features or bug fixes in the `cookbook` directory.
- Verify tests pass with:
  ```bash
  python -m cookbook.main
  ```
- If adding new dependencies, update `setup.py` (under `extras_require["test"]`) and `dev-requirements.txt`.

## Community Guidelines
We value a welcoming and inclusive community. Please:
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Be respectful and constructive in issues, pull requests, and discussions.
- Follow the [MIT License](LICENSE) terms.
- Reach out to `@sudoping01` for questions or guidance.


## Versioning and Releases
- We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Update the `version` field in `setup.py` when making changes:
  - Increment `MAJOR` for breaking changes.
  - Increment `MINOR` for new features.
  - Increment `PATCH` for bug fixes.
- To create a release:
  1. Update `setup.py` with the new version.
  2. Tag the release: `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
  3. maintainers will handle PyPI publication (contact `@sudoping01`).

**Pro Tip**: Check out the [Djelia SDK Cookbook](README.md#explore-the-djelia-sdk-cookbook) for a comprehensive example of using the SDK. It's a great way to understand the codebase before contributing!
